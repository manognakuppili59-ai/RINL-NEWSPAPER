Database engine and session setup using SQLAlchemy.

NOTE (Day 1): This module is created so the project structure is complete
and future modules can import `get_db` directly. No routes use this yet —
today's /health endpoint deliberately does NOT touch the database, to
keep the "backend is running" proof independent of MySQL being configured.
